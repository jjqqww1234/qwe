Hello. I'm Mr.Torre\
Do you know this year is the Golden-pig's year\
which comes in every 600 years?\
Celebrating it, Lucky 3 pig brothers will come to Mir land\
for a week. So I have a favor to ask you.\
Could you help me?\\
<Sure. What is it?/@next>\
<Sorry. I'm too busy to help you./@exit>

Catch Lucky pig, and bring me the pig head.\
There will be a lot of festival this year.\
We need some pig head for the banquet.\
If you bring it to me, I will give you something as a reward.\
Also LuckyLottery will be dropped by Lucky pig.\
When you have got a lottery. go to Katrina.\

Reward item depends on the number of\
pig head : 1, 10, 50, 100\
The more, the better.\
