#SAY
Hi my name is Light Rose of charming Rose Family.\
I came here to celebrate Legend of Mir2 5th year anniversary.\
Why aren't I inside the wall enjoying the festivals with everyone else\
you ask?\ Well thats is because I have a special gift for people during\
this event.\ \

#SAY
If i stand inside the wall and give out these special gifts the Guards\
around the town may get confused and destroy them.\ \
My special gift is for a small price of <$50,000> gold I will cast\
you an exact clone of yourself to help you hunt monsters.\
Would you like a clone?\
