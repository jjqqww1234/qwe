I'm sorry, but the task I wish to offer you\
is too dangerous for someone of your skill level.\
I suggest you to train more and come back to me.\

Sorry,\
We only have challenges for lesser trained heroes.\
Go and find my Big Brother,\
he will probably have a challenge for you.\\

Welcome, i see you have heard my advertisement that has \
been circulating, and that you are here for my challenges.\
I think with your skill and the help of others,\
You can take this challenge.\
Make sure you are completely prepared to enter my arena.\
As great Danger awaits you.\

<next/@next> 

[@next] 
Are you sure you are completely ready, I will let you enter.\
You can stay in there for a period of 2 hours.\
If you want to leave earlier, take a dungeon escape with you.\
I wish you good luck and hope to see you here again.\
