#SAY
Greetings, happy Easter Holiday to you stanger!\
I travel all around the continent during the Easter holidays\
spreading my easter stories and granting access to EasterLand\
which only opens once a year.\
<EasterLand?/@easterland>\
<Another time/@exit>

[@easterland]
EasterLand is a small land on the far reaches of the\
continent closed by a magical seal that only opens for\
7 days during the Easter Holiday period. It is home to\
some familiar monsters to you but they have been specially\
empowered by the seal to give special items to visitors.\
<How can i get there?/@getthere>\

[@getthere]
Only I can take you to this land, and I will do it for free\
since it is Easter Holiday.\
Would you like to go there?\ \
<Yes, please take me there/@eastermove>\
<Maybe later/@exit>
