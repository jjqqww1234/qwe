Jason asked my well-being? He admires my cooking skills?\
I'm not famous at all. I'm just a little better at extracting\
the original flavor from Meat than others.\
Well... some time ago, the 'Butcher Kim' of Bichon used\
to come here all the time, asking me to teach her how to\
cook so well, offering me all the money I want.\
I wonder how he is these days... Tell Jason that I am doing great.\ \
Butcher Kim in Bichon? Anyway I should go to <Jason/@exit>.

I used to have a reliable and dependable husband.\
He was a natural born businessman and used to travel\
here and there with a cart to trade goods.\
Although he was not very talkative, when he returned home\
from work, he always came with precious Silk, Spice,\
Hair pins, etc in his arms. He took good care of me,\
although I was still a young girl back then. \ \
<Listen/@level50part3-4> to the story
#ELSESAY
You have lost the Meat Soup

[@level50part3-4]
#SAY
This dress was also a gift from him. He told me that\
it was a brand new and expensive dress just delivered\
to the Bichon Drapery. Then one day.. He usually left\
home with his cart and few weeks later his wherabouts\
became unknown. By the time he went missing it wasn't\
even half a year since we got married.\
Can you imagine how a newlywed girl would feel? \ \
<Listen/@level50part3-5> to the story.

[@level50part3-5]
#SAY
I kept looking for him for a long time...\
But until now, I have been living on my own, not even\
knowing whether he is still alive or not.\
Ah, Only if I could know that he is alive...\ \ \ \
"Hmmm, May I help you find your <husband?/@level50part3-6>"

[@level50part3-6]
#SAY
Yes! He told me that there is a big job around the Sabuk wall.\
So he took the biggest cart with him when he left.\
I still clearly remember that he was waving me off,\
when he was leaving...\
Oh! Speaking of the cart... three years ago, a man told\
me that he lost his way around Sabuk wall and\
while wandering around, he saw a broken cart... Could it be?!\ \
"Do you remember <his name?/@level50part3-7>"

[@level50part3-7]
#SAY
It was quite a long time ago, but wait!...\
I think he said that he was going to the Tao Village!\ \ \

#ELSESAY

[@level50part12-2]
#SAY
Well... at least tell me where the broken cart was.\
I want to look for the things he left behind.\ \
( It's too dangerous for this woman to go there by herself. )\ \
( Ok no choice... <Make up an excuse./@level50part12-3> )

[@level50part12-3]
#SAY
Hmmm... you got there coincidentally after a sandstorm...\
I was hoping that I could find something, maybe a piece of\
cloth that was on his body...\
Ahh... I can't help it...\ \ \

[@level50part12-4]

Thank you but I can live on my own...\
I appreciate what you have done for me.\
