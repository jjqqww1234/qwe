#SAY
Wow, the mighty hero has come.\
Do you know Khera who lives in the Mongchon province\
by any chance?\
Her cooking skills are so good that Butcher Kim of\
Bichon province is desperate to learn her skills.\ \
<Is she the lady/@level50next1> in red dress?

[@level50next1]
#SAY
Precisely!\
I've heard that her husband gave the dress to her as a present.\
As a matter of fact... It has been already 20 years since\
her husband disappeared. At the time, it was quite\
big news since a newlywed husband had disappeared all of a\ 
sudden without a trace.\
It was the talk of the whole continent.\
<Perhaps I should find Khera/@level50next2>

If by chance you get to go to Mongchon Province,\
Give Khera my best regards.\ \ \

#SAY
Khera asked about me? Wow... I knew she had turned into an old lady.\
But i once had secret feelings about her...\
I can still see her sweet smile... If it only wasn't for 'the man'...\ \
Hmph!! Anyway, the Butcher Kim seems to be working on\
something these days. Why dont you give her a visit?\ \
<I should go find out/@exit>
