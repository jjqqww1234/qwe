#SAY
Greetings stranger, my name is Khin and I'm the master\
of the most famous guilds of this Town. I'm\
currently looking for pumpkins to prepare my special dishes\
for Halloween celebrations. If you'd like to help\
you might want to look for those Jack'o'Lanterns in dungeons.\ \
<What can I get in return for my help?/@next>\
<Here are your pumpkins/@pumpkin>\
<I don't care, sorry/@exit>

#SAY
If you can bring me the soul of one of those Jack'o'Lanterns\
I can use my knowledge to prepare a special helmet for you. A\
helmet made out of pumpkins and with the power given by the\
restless soul of this monster. Wear it while hunting undead\
monsters and you will get the chance to find some special items.\ \
<I will look for your pumpkins/@look>\
<I don't care, sorry/@exit>

#SAY
Oh thanks!\
Bring me back at least 5 Pumpkins and a restless soul and I\
will prepare the special Pumpkin Helmet for you!\ \ \ \
<I will be back!/@exit>

You don't have enough pumpkins for me. Please come back\
