Many centuries ago when this land was still part of the Bichon\
Continent these lands were home to many wild animals such as Deer\
and Hen. Green grass as far as the eye could see, until one early dawn\
around the time of the Easter Holidays a giant glowing meteor\ 
in the shape of an egg plunged into the far east blocking the\ 
mountain pass between here and the early Bichon Wall.\

Within minutes the egg exploded into a magical seal which covered\
the whole east side from north to south, spreading fire and drought\
to the whole eastern side of the land. The wild animals started dying\
off, the Hens all died away quickly and the few remaining Deer\
were pushed onto the west side of the land. Over time the east side\
of the land became a barron desert. Whilst the west side was still\
hanging on to the gentle green garden look it had retained for\
hundreds of years.\

The land looked to stay this way for the distant future until mysteriously\
the early ancestors of the Oma began inhabiting the east side of the\
land. It is thought the seal spawned them but noone really knows.\
All we do know is that they are empowered by it and live from its power.\
It started off only very small numbers of Oma, but gradually increased\ 
until they covered the entire land, finally wiping out the recovering \
Deer herds. Leading up to what you see here today.\
