Watch out, \ 
You are approaching a gateway between evil powers and the normal world. \ 
Last year i was also here, and before i knew i was somewhere else. \ 
A place full of terror and evil monsters, \ 
i ran for my life. \ 
There were loads of evil beast running after me. \ 
I found a deep small corner where i could hide myself \ 
and where those evil creatures couldn't reach me. \\
