Well.. about three years ago, I was on a mission given\
from Master Perry. I was supposed to deliver a precious\
book from the Sabuk wall lord and I was on my way back to\
Tao village.\
Then one day... I lost my way in the midnight...\
After hours of aimless wandering, I suddenly felt a chill.\
When i raised my eyes, I saw a skull infront of me!\ \

After that I wandered in vain and couldn't think of anything.\
Hurried back to Tao village and was severely scolded by Master Perry.\
I tried to get back to the place again\
but couldn't find the way...\
Mmm... a mighty hero like you may be able to find the way...\ \

Please bring it to me. Please.\ \
