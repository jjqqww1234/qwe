#SAY
You may have the power to help me...\
Argh! Under my feet lives a King Centipede.\
It is seizing me and constantly giving me pain...\
Please help me...\ \
"Mmm... I'll <hear/@level50part9-2> his story first"

[@level50part9-2]
#SAY
The King Centipede has became parasitic on me\
when I was wandering as a spirit after attacked by monsters.\
By absorbing my vitailty, it grew bigger and bigger.\
And in a few days, my vitailty will be completely dried up\
and my soul will be completely destroyed.\
Only a mighty hero like you can help me out of this situation...\ \
"I think I can help <you/@level50part9-3>"

[@level50part9-3]
#SAY
Wow...\ \

You can only get there through me. Here... Grab my hand.\
I'll take you to where the King Centipede is.\ \

#SAY
Thank you. Now the pain is gone...\
Thank you for your help.\
Wait, I can sense my wife Khera from you.\ \ \
"Aren't you Milford, the missing <husband?/@level50part11-2>"

[@level50part11-2]
#SAY
Many years ago... Because of the attacks by monsters\
people couldn't move freely around the Mir continent.\
I was bold and young after learning a few skills from\
a master in the past, I defeated some monsters, wandered places\
and made considerable amount of money with my business.\
And then one day... a big market was held in Sabuk wall...\ \
<Listen to/@level50part11-3> the story.

[@level50part11-3]
#SAY
I sold all my goods and my pocket was filled with money.\
Then i bought a gift for Khera and wanted to run to Mongchon\
as fast as possible thinking about how happy Khera will be\
with the present. That night... the old man who rid the\
horses insisted that it's too dangerous travelling at night\
and tried to persuade me to start the journey in the morning...\ \
<Listen/@level50part11-4> to the story.

[@level50part11-4]
#SAY
But I wanted to see her so much so I packed up and departed from\
Sabuk wall. Sigh... I should've listened to the old man..\
After a while departing from Sabuk wall, we were passing by a pond\
and we were suddenly attacked by monsters. The horses and the old man\
were killed by the monsters but I resisted and fought.\ \
<Listen/@level50part11-5> to the story.

[@level50part11-5]
#SAY
I luckily slew all the monsters, but I was also fatally wounded...\
Before i died... I pulled myself together and left a note leaving\
traces for this place.\
And I became a wandering spirit without a physical body.\ \
"Then why are you <staying/@level50part11-6> here?"

[@level50part11-6]
#SAY
That's because i burried the gift for my wife here.\
I prepared it for our wedding anniversary.\
There aren't any people around here and it's not\
easy to find this place so I buried it here.\ \
<Listen to/@level50part11-7> the story.

[@level50part11-7]
#SAY
Mmmm... That's why I have a favor to ask of you.\
I want you to deliver this box to Khera...\
Will you please do it for me?\ \ \
<Take the box/@level50part11-8>

#SAY
The box is locked so tell her that she can find the key from\
the red dress i gave her and please don't say anything about me...\
Tell her that you found the box with a note from the broken cart.\
And please tell her that she ought to meet a new man to start\
a new life...\ \
"I'll <tell her that/@exit>"

#ACT
SET [207] 1
#SAY
Thank you for deliverring the box for me...\
But I am worried that Khera may not know how to mend\
her dress to find th ekey for the box...\
Please will you help her mend it? You should know how to do it.\ \ \
I will <help/@exit> her mend it.

[@level50part13recheck]

( I told him that Khera wanted me to put this next to the corpse... )\
Thank you... And this is a little compensation for the 'Chrysanthemum'\ \
" What do you plan to <do/@level50ending-3> now? "

[@level50ending-3]
#SAY
After being killed by the monster, fortunately, I was not enslaved by the monsters\
However... although the centipede is gone... The evil force still haunts me\
so I can't get out of here now... Perhaps if lasting peace comes to the continent\
I may be born again... If you get to pass this place in the future,\
will you tell me how she's doing? Farewell, and take care...\
" I will drop by sometime. "\ \
(<Go back/@exit> to Khera again.)
