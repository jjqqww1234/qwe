What Item would you like to buy?\ \ \
 <back/@main>


[@sell]
What Item would you like to sell?\ \ \
 <Back/@main>

[@questionprize]
We treat only <candle/@candle>, and <teleport/@teleport>,\
But we heard that there are <Random Teleport Scroll/@teleport2>,\
<Town Teleport Scroll/@steleport> and <Repair Oil/@repairoil>\
that can be aquired from monster or bought from other store.\ \
 <Back/@main>

[@candle]
You can use candle when it's dark. If you do not have candle\
it will be so dark you can't see even around yourself.\ \
 <Back/@questionprize>


[@teleport]
Dungeon Escape Scroll is teleportation document that can move you\
randomly near last visited village in a moment.\ 
It's weaker in movement force than Town Teleport\
but it can save your life while in danger.\ \
 <Back/@questionprize>


[@teleport2]
Random Teleport Scroll is teleportation document that\
can move you randomly in the same map you actually are.\
It's dangerous but if you want to keep hunting after teleport\
it can be verry usefull\ \
 <Back/@questionprize>


[@steleport]
Town Teleport Scroll is created by an old magic skill\
coming from ancient time and now, unfortunantly, lost\
but we heard that some monsters still have these scrolls.\
If you use it you can return to village directly...\ \
 <Back/@questionprize> 


[@repairoil]
Repair oil can restore durability of hand carried weapon\
It isn't like special repair so if you use it\
don't forget that durability of that weapon will decrease slowly.\
If weapon is not so expensive, it'll be helpful for long hunting to carry one\
or two bottle and apply it for repair\ \
